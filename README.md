# affine-compression
visualize simplest affine transformation <\b>
I was doing geometry and thought about making a little visualizer of a compression. <\b>
Since it is actually quite simple, I did it in Zig a language that I don't master at all at the moment. <\b>
I'm going to enhance this by adding new affine transformation, a way of visualizing projective transformation and some fun things such as minimal area triangle inscribed on the ellipse. <\b>
(fun math problem actually).
